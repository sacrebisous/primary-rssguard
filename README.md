Note: The icon theme is sorta half-assed in the sense 
that they don't all appear in the program properly.
I still included it because it works a little better 
with this theme than the default icon sets. I'll fix it
someday... or not.


## Installation:
1. Exit RSS Guard (if it's open).
2. Unzip this archive wherever you'd like.
3. Drag the data4 folder into your RSS Guard installation
   directory (should be at C:\RSS Guard if you used the 
   installer, otherwise it will be wherever you unzipped 
   the program.)
4. Open RSS Guard.
5. Navigate to Tools > Settings > User interface.
6. Set the Icon theme to "suru" and Skin to "primary".
7. Navigate to Feeds & articles settings.
8. Change the font to "Karla" through the Feeds list, 
   Articles, and Articles list tabs.
9. Restart RSS Guard.
